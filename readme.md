# Ruby 2 Class Extensions

_Various class extension methods for Ruby 2_

### Overview

This is a collection of extension methods for Ruby 2 classes. They will probably work with other versions, but they have been written on and tested with 2.x

Extension classes requiring other extension classes to be loaded begin with `load 'other_extension.rb'`, expected in the current directory; adjust this for your local environment as needed; depending on how you run your code, `load` statements inside the scripts may not load, and might require you to include `load` statements in your own code.
